<h1>Welcome to AlmaLinux</h1>
<a href="http://www.almalinux.org/">AlmaLinux</a> is an open-source, community-driven project that intends to fill the gap left by the demise of the CentOS stable release. AlmaLinux is a 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL® 9 and it is built by the AlmaLinux OS Foundation as a standalone, completely free OS. We will support future RHEL® releases by updating AlmaLinux. Ongoing development efforts are governed by the members of the community.
